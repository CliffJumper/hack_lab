# AWS Cloud Environment with Terraform

This document provides information about setting up and using AWS-based virtual machines in the hack lab environment using Terraform for infrastructure as code.

## Overview
This environment uses Terraform to provision and manage AWS infrastructure, providing a consistent and reproducible way to create isolated hacking environments. The infrastructure is defined as code, making it easy to version control, share, and modify.

## Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed (version 1.0.0 or later)
- Basic understanding of AWS services and Terraform
- Git for version control

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the AWS environment directory
3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
4. Review the planned changes:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
5. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Infrastructure Components
The Terraform configuration will create:
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Security groups for different types of instances
- EC2 instances for various purposes
- IAM roles and policies
- S3 buckets for storage
- CloudWatch logging

## Configuration
The main configuration files are:
- `main.tf` - Main Terraform configuration
- `variables.tf` - Input variables
- `outputs.tf` - Output values
- `terraform.tfvars` - Variable values (not tracked in git)

## Common Issues
- **State Management**: Use remote state storage (S3 + DynamoDB) for team collaboration
- **Cost Control**: Implement proper tagging and monitoring
- **Security**: Follow AWS security best practices and use least privilege principle

## Cleanup
To destroy the infrastructure when done:
```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Best Practices
1. Always use workspaces for different environments
2. Implement proper state locking
3. Use modules for reusable components
4. Follow naming conventions
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Use data sources for existing resources
7. Implement proper backup strategies
