# hack_lab
This repo creates a lab of virtual machines and a virtual network to use as a safe, isolated lab for hacking/training.

Over time, I'll work to implement lab environments based on several technologies (qemu, Windows Hyper-V, etc.)



## Environments
- [QEMU](docs/qemu.md) - Open source machine emulator and virtualizer
- [Hyper-V](docs/hyper-v.md) - Microsoft's hardware virtualization product
- [AWS](docs/aws.md) - Cloud-based virtualization environment
